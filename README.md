# Particle Swarm Optimization

Pretty simple implementation of the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The actual algorithm has been tweaked a little in order to make better predictions (at least that was the case during experiments).

The pso.m function is built in a generic way so that any objective function (and its constraints) can be passed to it.
